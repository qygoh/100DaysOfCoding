# The 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Starting my [100 days of Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM3@rzEvGYVsRN4j7JPodarP92VNnpuzSy-ndSn_MvYOVTAPzphOiujHfPYGtgCGnv0P/), and thought why not I challenge myself to produce something extra for each day of the course?

Hence the birth of this repo- it shall be a documentation for all the things that I will be creating for the course
