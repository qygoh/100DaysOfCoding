# Day 1: Christmas Santa Generator
**Date: 16/05/2022**

Main aim is to explore the usage of the input function in Python. 

**Use Case:** Decided to build my own Christmas Santa generator! Inspired by my department's Christmas Food Santa Exchange where everyone is supposed to order food for one other individual. 

How does this generator work: 
1. Key in the number of participants
2. Proceed to input the names of each participant
3. Generator will automatically generate the pairings of participants without any repeated pairings! 

Note: 
- If there is an odd number of participants, unfortunately there will be a group of 3. 
- Currently the working version assumes that within each group the individuals are buying lunches for each other
- In reality would have wanted the code to give me unique directional pairings instead (to work on for future updates)
